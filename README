A gross little hack / scratching an itch.

The site MDBG.net provides RSS feeds for the 6 levels of HSK Chinese vocabulary lists.
I tried to set up Twitter accounts for each vocab list through Twitterfeed.com,
but found that the tweets soon stopped coming through.
Investigated with Twitterfeed.com support, and found that the MDBG RSS feeds were
repeating, with the same ID and link each time - Twitterfeed requires a unique ID/link
each time to track what has already been posted.

This app fills the gap - it reads the RSS feeds (once per day - conveniently, the free
tier on Heroku restarts apps daily, so the feeds are re-read on startup), and modifies
the links and IDs (by adding a datestamp), and then makes the modifed RSS feeds available.

I re-pointed Twitterfeed to my app and the vocab lists now (sort-of) make it to Twitter.
(sort-of, because only the first entry from each day's feed gets posted ...)


... after typing the above, it occurs that I should just post directly to Twitter
from my app, cut out the middle-feed.  On the other hand, there are 6 twitter accounts,
so I'd have to figure out app authorisation 6 times over.  Hmmm ...
